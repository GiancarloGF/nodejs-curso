# nodejs-curso
This is my first app on Nodejs using basic methods that interact with the File System(fs), Operative System(os), readline, and modules.
What we have achieved is to make a basic text editor.
This was made with the knowledge from a course of Nodejs for beginners from VIDA MRR on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29qAWo2JRWk&list=PLvRPaExkZHFn_EGzNOXsWqtAAGl8ZCbUo&index=16
